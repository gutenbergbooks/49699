He deserves all the squeezing he has

what a mob is here! Who raked all
this filthy crowd together? Honest
friend, take away your elbow. What
a beastly crew am I got among! What
a smell! Oh, and such squeezing.
Why, you overgrown sloven, says a
footman, that stood by, who makes
half so much noise and crowding as
you? reduce your own fat paunch to a
reasonable compass, sirrah, and there
will be room enough for us all. Upon
this, the whole company set up a shout,
and crowding around my friend Tunbelly,
so left an opening, through which
I made my escape, and have brought
off Dick Wilson with me, who, by being
heartily squeezed, and having twelve
of his ten toes trod off, is now cured
of his impertinent curiosity. But you
desire an account of the fair, and I mean

<p class='c006'>The man of the world for gingerbread.
What do you buy, what do
you buy? says the old gentleman;
please to buy a gingerbread wife, sir;
here’s a very delicate one. Indeed
there is too much gold on the nose;
but that is no objection to those who
drive Smithfield bargains, and marry
their wives by weight. Will you please
to have a gingerbread husband, madam;
I assure you, you may have a
worse; or a watch, madam; here are
watches for belles, beaux, bucks, and
blockheads. But here comes Master
Punch. See, there he is, with his
hunch at his back. The crowd that
came with him obliged us to leave the
place: but just as we were going, Giles
called out, Gentlemen, buy a house
before you go. ’Tis better to buy than
to build. You have heard of the Cock
that crowed in the morn, that waked
the Priest all shaven and shorn, that
married the Man all tattered and torn,
that kissed the Maiden all forlorn, that
milked the Cow with the crumpled
horn, that tossed the Dog, that worried
the Cat, that killed the Rat, that ate
the Malt, that lay in the House that
Jack built. If there is any part you
do not like, you may eat it; buy, gentlemen,
buy, and don’t build. Many
of my friends have ruined themselves
by building. The insufferable folly of
building a fine house, has obliged many
a man to lie in the street. Observe
what the poet says on the subject:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The man who builds the finest place,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And cannot for it pay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is sure to feel his wretched case,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While others in it lay.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_12.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>A little further we saw one with the
Wheel of Fortune before him, playing
with children for oranges. What do
you say? Twenty may play as well as
one. Ay, and all may lose I suppose.
Go away, sirrah, what, do you teach,
children to game!—Gaming is a scandalous
practice. The gamester, the
liar, the thief, and the pickpocket, are
first cousins, and ought all to be turned
out of company.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_13.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>At this instant up came <i>Dick Sadbury</i>,
crying. And what do you think
he cries for? Why he has been at the
gaming table, or in other words at the
Wheel of Fortune, and lost all the
money that was given him by his father
and mother, and the fairings that he
received from Mr. Long, Mr. Williams,
and Mrs. Goodenough. At first he
won an orange, put it into his pocket,
and was pleased; and then he won a
knife, whipt it up, and was happy;
after this he won many other things,
till at last Fortune turned against him,
as at one time or other she always does
against those that come to her wheel
and seek her favours, and he was
choused out of all his money, and
brought nothing away but a half-penny
jew’s-harp. Why do you bellow so,
you monkey? Go away, and learn
more sense for the future.</p>

      <div class='line'>For she does all her votaries trick,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And you’ll her disappointment feel.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Never game, or if you do, never play
for money. Avoid a gamester as you

comes to devour you.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gentlemen and Ladies, I am the
doctor of all doctors, the great doctor
of doctors, who can doctor you all. I
ease your pains gratis, cure you for
nothing, and sell you my packets that
you may never be sick again. (Enter
Andrew blowing on a scrubbing-broom.)
Sirrah, where have you been
this morning?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> Been, sir! why I have
been on my travels, sir, with my knife,
sir; I have travelled round this great
apple. Besides this, I have travelled
through the fair, sir, and bought all
these gingerbread books at a man’s
stall, who sells learning by weight and
measure, arithmetic by the gross, geometry
by the square, and physic and
philosophy by the pound. So I bought
the philosophy: and left the physic for
you, master.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Doctor.</i> Why, sirrah, do you never
take physic?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> Yes, master, sometimes.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Doctor.</i> What sort do you take?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> Any sort, no matter what;
’tis all one to me.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Doctor.</i> And how do you take it?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> Why I take it—I take
it—and put it upon a shelf: and if I
don’t get well, I take it down again,
and work it off with good strong ale.
But you shall hear me read in my
golden books, master.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>He that can dance with a bag at his back,</div>

      <div class='line'>He who is healthy, and cheerful, and cool,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet squanders his money on physic’s a <i>fool</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fool, master, fool, master, fool, fool.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>Doctor.</i> Sirrah, you blockhead. I’ll
break your head.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> What, for reading my book,
sir?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Doctor.</i> No; for your impudence,
puppy. But come, good people, throw
up your handkerchiefs, you lose time
by attending to that blundering booby;
and by and by you’ll be in a hurry,
and we shall not be able to serve you.
Consider, gentlemen and ladies, in one
of these packets is deposited a curious
gold ring, which the purchaser, whoever
he may happen to be, will have for
a shilling, together with all the packet
of medicines; and every other adventurer
will have a packet for one shilling,
which he may sell for ten times that
sum.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> Master, master, I’ll tell
you how to get this ring, and a great
deal of money into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Doctor.</i> How, sirrah?</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> Why, buy up all of them
yourself, and you will be sure of the
ring, and have the packets to sell for
ten shillings a-piece.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Doctor.</i> That’s true; but you are
covetous, sirrah: you are covetous, and
want to get money.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> And, master, I believe
you don’t want to get physic.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Doctor.</i> Yes I do.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Andrew.</i> Then ’tis to get rid of it.

<p class='c004'><i>Sam Sensible’s Account of what he had
seen in the Fair; particularly a Description
of the Up-and-down, and
other Things.</i></p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_21.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='xlarge'>I</span>T is strange! but some children will
never take advice, and always are
running into dangers and difficulties.
That silly chit, <i>Wat Wilful</i>, has been
riding upon the Up-and-down, and is
fallen off, and almost killed. You
know what I mean by the Up-and-down?
It is a horse in a box, a horse
that flies in the air, like that which the
ancient poets rode on.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_22.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>And here is poor Wat, and his mother
lamenting over him.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_23.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>If he had taken her advice, all had
been well; for as he was going to
mount, Wat, says she, don’t be so
ambitious. Ambitious people generally
tumble; and when once down, it is
not easy to get up again. Remember
what your poor father used to read
about Cardinal Wolsey.</p>

<p class='c006'>Farewell, a long farewell to all my
greatness! This is the state of man:
to-day he puts forth the tender leaves
of hope, to-morrow blossoms, and bears
his blushing honours thick upon him:
The third day comes a frost, a killing
frost, and when he thinks, good easy
man, full surely his greatness is a ripening,
nips his root, and then he falls as
I do. I have ventured, like little wanton
boys that swim on bladders, these
many summers on a sea of glory; but
far beyond my depth! My high-blown
pride at length broke under me, and
now has left me weary, and old with
service, to the mercy of a rude stream
that must for ever hide me. Vain
pomp and glory of the world, I hate
ye, I feel my heart new opened.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_24.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>But Wilful would, and so down he
tumbled, and lies there a warning to
the obstinate and ambitious. Had he
taken his mother’s advice, and rode
upon the Roundabout, as Dick Stamp
and Will Somer did, he might have
whipped and spurred for an hour without
doing any mischief, or receiving
any hurt. But he was a proud and obstinate
silly boy.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>Descant on Time.</i></h3>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_25.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Now, my young friends, though you
have had a treatise on many pleasing
and important subjects, yet there is one
remains, and that <i>one</i> should not be forgot.
Therefore I shall introduce a descant
on <i>Time</i>; and this I hope will
meet with your approbation; for the
sole intent of this little book is to furnish
you with such lessons as may improve
your understanding, and ripen your
judgment.</p>

<p class='c006'>You have just been informed by the
poet, that Time is a wonder-worker,
and truly it may well be called so. It
is an awful revolutionist, for it brings
strange things to pass, and occasions
innumerable vicissitudes in the world.
Though it is continually moving on, yet
its advancements are so slow and progressive,
that we frequently disregard
its course. But, that time is uncertain,
and Death may cut you off, even in
your youth. Therefore improve the
present hour, for you know not what
the next day may bring forth. Slow as
it seems to be, it steals upon us, and
gently leads us from childhood to old
age. When we arrive at our three-score
years, then we begin to think
that time runs on apace, and wish we
had employed the fleeting hours to
more advantage. Here, my young
friends, is the fatal error which thousands
experience to their cost; for
they pursue their foolish vanities, and
never consider that time is given us for
the express purpose of preparing for
eternity. Let me admonish you to
think better, and always bear this truth
in your minds.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/section.png' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>
<h3 class='c007'><i>On Learning.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible to enumerate all the
advantages which are derived from
education, or learning. It qualifies us
for every station, and never fails to
prove an invaluable ornament to its
possessor. But the Dunce appears in a
very different light; for he is the scoff
of society, and must of necessity drudge
through a life of ignorance and slavery.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>On Business.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>It is of little consequence what your
calling is, provided you fulfil your station
with honesty and integrity, for that
is the true source of contentment: and
if you are satisfied with that state in
which God hath placed you, not even
kings can desire, or be possessed of
more, perhaps not so much; because
the higher the station, the greater the
cares.</p>

<h3 class='c007'><i>On Idleness.</i></h3>

<p class='c008'>It would be thought a hard government
that should tax its people one-tenth
part of their time to be employed
in its service; but idleness taxes many
of us much more, if we reckon all that
is spent in absolute sloth, or in doing of
nothing, with that which is spent in
idle employments or amusements, that
amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing
on diseases, absolutely shortens life.
“Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than
labour wears, while the used key is
always bright.”</p>
